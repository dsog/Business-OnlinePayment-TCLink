I. DESCRIPTION

  This is Business::OnlinePayment::TCLink, a Business::OnlinePayment
backend module for TrustCommerce. It is only useful if you have an
account with TrustCommerce: http://www.trustcommerce.com

  Dan Helfman <dan@trustcommerce.com> is the author. The module is
derived from code by Jason Kohles and Ivan Kohler. Email
developer@trustcommerce.com for help with using this module.

  Business::OnlinePayment is a generic interface for processing payments
through online credit card processors, online check acceptance houses,
etc. (If you like buzzwords, call it an "multiplatform
ecommerce-enabling middleware solution").

II. BUILD

  First, follow the instructions in the Net::TCLink Perl package
(distributed separately) to install it as root. The package is availble at:

  http://trustcommerce.com/tclink.html

  To build Business::OnlinePayment::TCLink, you need only execute the
following two commands:

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make

III. INSTALLATION

  If you wish to install globally (recommended), execute the following
command as root:

  # make install

  If you do not have root priviledges on the machine, or do not wish to
install Business::OnlinePayment::TCLink globally, you may still load the
module manually from the blib directory where it is built. Assuming the
name of your test script is test.pl, use the following command line:

  $ perl -Iblib/arch -Iblib/lib test.pl

  You may wish to change "blib/arch" and "blib/lib" to be the full path
to those locations, so that you may execute the command anywhere.

  Or, you may insert the following code at the top of your script:

use lib "blib/lib";
use lib "blib/arch";

   Again, you may prefer to use the full path name here.

IV. USAGE

  The perldoc documentation contains usage information and some example
code. Access it as follows:

  $ perldoc Business::OnlinePayment::TCLink

  Information on integrating this module with the Freeside billing and
account administration package is available in README.freeside.
